## Project Aim

TurnedIn aims to simplify the process of connecting idea owners and potential investors in Indonesia through a user-friendly digital platform. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive, intuitive, and community-based solution for businesses seeking capital and investors looking for diverse and quality investment opportunities. In a world increasingly shaped by digital advancements, TurnedIn transforms the traditional and time-consuming process of pitching ideas and finding safe investment destinations into an efficient, integrated, and accessible experience.

Accessible via smartphones, TurnedIn serves both general users, fostering investment awareness, and authenticated users who can leverage all features to connect with partner investors or idea owners. The platform includes discussion features, search options, filters, and secure meeting appointments to facilitate meaningful connections. We believe that every idea owner, regardless of their level, should have equal opportunities to develop their business, and investors should easily find potential investment destinations. TurnedIn addresses these unique needs, offering a reliable solution that streamlines the journey for both idea owners and fund owners.
